## Article Pricing Data

In addition to allowing an individual reader to purchase article access for themselves,
LinketySplit also allows for purchasing one or more article accesses for a reader to 
share with friends and colleagues. The article pricing model therefore includes the notion 
of discount tiers based on quantity.

<Aside>
Specifying discount tiers is entirely optional.
</Aside>



### Definition

```ts 
type ArticlePricingData = {
  // The base article price for 1 article access, 
  // in US cents. Must be an integer.
  price: number;
  // Array of up two five discount tiers
  discounts: ArticlePricingDiscountTier[];
}
type ArticlePricingDiscountTier = {
  // The minimum access quantity for the tier to be
  // in effect.  Must be an integer greater than 1.
  quantity: number;
  // The unit price for the discount tier, in US cents. 
  // Must be an integer.
  price: number;
}
```

<Aside>
In addition to obeying the types noted above, each discount tier must have a lower price than the previous tier (or the base article price, if it's the first discount tier.)
